The Kasiski examination involves searching for repeated sequences of three or more characters
in the ciphertext. These sequences are likely to result from the same plaintext letters being
encrypted using the same part of the keyword. By calculating the distance between these repeated
sequences, it is possible to determine the likely length of the keyword. Afterward, we can separate
the ciphertext into sections with the same length as the guessed key length and compute the
histogram of each character in each position in each section. The obtained frequency distribution
can further be compared to the frequency table of the English language to determine the possible
shift in the distribution.
